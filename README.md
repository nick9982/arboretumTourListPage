### Usage:

-NodeJS 18.8.0 or the latest lts version is recommended

Clone the repository with "git clone"


"cd" into the directory and run "npm install" this will install the relevant node modules


Once that's done, type "npm run dev" and a console should start up a server with a link to where you can view the project.


I believe the default port is: http://localhost:5173/
